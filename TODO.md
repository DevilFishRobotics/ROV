# TODO list for ROV-related development

1. Build abstraction layers for comms between mcu and sensors.

    - Depth Sensor
    - IMU
    - Leak Sensors
    - Temperature Sensors

## MCU

- Arduino MEGA Rev3 - aka ATMega2560.

  - 15 said PWM OP pins. 8 of which we need for our 8 thrusters.
  - It's Possible to run Native RTOS on a mega.
